Intuitively, in maximin the maximization comes after the minimization, so player i tries to maximize their value before knowing what the others will do; in minimax the maximization comes before the minimization, so player i is in a much better position â€“ they maximize their value knowing what the others did.

Another way to understand the notation is by reading from right to left: When we writeThe following example of a zero-sum game, where A and B make simultaneous moves, illustrates maximin solutions. Suppose each player has three choices and consider the payoff matrix for A displayed on the table ("Payoff matrix for player A"). Assume the payoff matrix for B is the same matrix with the signs reversed (i.e. if the choices are A1 and B1 then B pays 3 to A). Then, the maximin choice for A is A2 since the worst possible result is then having to pay 1, while the simple maximin choice for B is B2 since the worst possible result is then no payment. However, this solution is not stable, since if B believes A will choose A2 then B will choose B1 to gain 1; then if A believes B will choose B1 then A will choose A1 to gain 3; and then B will choose B2; and eventually both players will realize the difficulty of making a choice. So a more stable strategy is needed.
